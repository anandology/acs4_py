This hack is used to support lending returnable books - rather than
piece together queries with the ACS4 xml API, we peek at the mysql
database.

Urls this supports:

(arg=acs4 resource ID)

curl http://servername.org/bss/bss.py/is_loaned_out/$arg

curl http://servername.org/bss/bss.py/resource_info/$arg

curl http://servername.org/bss/bss.py/fulfillment_info/$arg


If the argument is not specified, you get info about all resources.


You might need indexes to help performance.  YMMV.


Responses are in JSON.


It'll be handy if your mysql and acs4 server system clocks are
correct and in UTC.
